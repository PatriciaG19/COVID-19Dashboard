The next step is deploying the dashboard online - there are several [options](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploy.html) for this, we suggest deploying as a [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). This is basically the same technique that has been used to package this tutorial and to deploy this template dashboard. The instructions may seem a bit involved, but the actual steps are surprisingly easy - we will be going through them together during a live session. You will need an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for this - if you don't have one already, now it's the time to create it. "
